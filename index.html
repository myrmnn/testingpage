<h1>Lizzy's First Website</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Lizzy's first website, where she will explore what HTML and CSS is.</p>
    
    <h2>What she might want to do first:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Download VSCode</li>
        <li>Install Live Server on VSCode</li>
        <li>Create a github account</li>
        <li>Bookmark MDN</li>
        <li>Have fun!</li>
        <li>booboobeeboo</li>
    </ul>

    <ol></ol>
    
    <p>Next, we will open up a working file in VSCode to start making a copy of this page!</p>
    
    <p>First you have to understand that HTML and CSS are languages that are used to control the look of how websites appear to users. They are separate languages and are each stored in their own files.</p>
    
    <p>So what we need to do is open up two files, one will be called index.html and the other will be called styles.css. These are separate files that are then linked together.</p>
